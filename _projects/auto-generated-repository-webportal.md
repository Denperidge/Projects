pro:
  - No external dependencies.
  - No authentication nor webscraping necessary.
  - After a one-time setup (running the python script and throwing that onto
    GitHub Pages or something alike), it's all client side.
con:
  - The .md template is built into the python code, making it difficult to
    change.
  - Everything is loaded into one big page.
  - It still requires a one-time setup.
