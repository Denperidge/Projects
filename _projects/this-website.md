description: A website to showcase my projects. Well, this.
pro:
  - Headless Netlify CMS + Jekyll for a delightful serverless/JAMStack
    experience!
  - A nice rundown of some of my accomplishments, what I did well, and what I
    have learned from.
  - The GitHub card & repo url are auto-generated, as only repo owner & repo
    name are saved, no full URL.
con:
  - The styling (minima theme + how the projects are displayed) is quite basic.
  - I'd like to develop a more automated process later on, where repository info
    is automatically grabbed from an URL.
