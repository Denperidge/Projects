layout: project
title: A website that stores & shares secrets.
repoowner: Denperidge
reponame: A-Secret-Website
description: Every time you open the site, you have to enter a secret of your
  own. Only then, will you be able to see secrets that others have entered!
pro:
  - I really like the name and concept. Go me?
  - It's a small project, but relatively well navigateable and useable.
con:
  - It has no built-in defence mechanisms (against unauthorised clears,
    vandalism...)
  - Its reliance on PHP & SQL makes it inable to live on in GitHub pages.
