description: Overgrowth is a really unique fighting game. And it even has the
  code for split-screen multiplayer in the game! But it's inaccessible without
  opening the dev pane and manually inserting new characters, one by one, after
  every loading screen. With this mod, all you need is 1 button press for adding
  a player, and 1 button press to remove one!
pro:
  - It works! Coding mods for games is difficult, but fun.
  - Getting help from friends was a great idea. The cover art illustration is
    adorable!
con:
  - There were some small bugs that I didn't get around to fixing.
