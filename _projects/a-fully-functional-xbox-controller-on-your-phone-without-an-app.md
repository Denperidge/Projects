title: A fully functional xbox controller on your phone, without an app
repoowner: Denperidge
reponame: xPortable
website: ""
description: Connect through your phones web browser to the locally hosted
  webserver on your computer, and bam, the pc treats it as an Xbox-controller.
pro:
  - Only an install on the computer, none on the phone.
  - The PC fully registers it like a normal controller, thus it works with all
    controller-supported games.
  - Multiple controllers supported.
  - Vibration feedback included.
con:
  - Windows-only (although for a project like this, that is inevitable).
  - For some games, it was too difficult to use. Although this is also an
    unavoidable problem, considering the LB/LT & RB/RT are hard to simulate on a
    touch-screen.
