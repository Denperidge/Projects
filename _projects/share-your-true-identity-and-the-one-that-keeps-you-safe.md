title: Share your true identity, and the one that keeps you safe.
repoowner: Denperidge
reponame: variable-closet
website: https://variable-closet.denperidge.com/
description: "Sadly, its not safe for some people to come out. Or they're simply
  not accepted. This website allows someone to create an overview for the people
  close to them: of how they prefer to be known, as well as the old identity and
  the people that still know them under it."
pro:
  - Fully client-side, with maximized privacy.
  - I like the update-to-querystring solution (mostly visible with the top
    inputs).
con:
  - "Unfinished: still very barebones, especially in styling."
  - Largely superseded by [pronouns.page](https://pronouns.page).
  - "The full client-side caveat: no automated updates, new links would have to
    be shared after any updates."
