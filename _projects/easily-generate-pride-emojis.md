title: Easily generate pride emojis
repoowner: Denperidge
reponame: " pride-emoji-generator"
description: Grab SVG shape cutouts and a folder of flags/images, run a script,
  have a bunch of emojis!
pro:
  - Using Zaimki as a Git Submodule future proofs the application more.
  - Quickly add representation with minimal busywork.
  - The script outputs regular PNG's, and only needs to be run once.
con:
  - Releases could and should be automated.
  - An user-interface for selecting which shapes & flags to use would go a long
    way for end-user customisation.
