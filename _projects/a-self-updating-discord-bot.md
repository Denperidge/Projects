title: A self-updating Discord bot
repoowner: Denperidge
reponame: discat
description: This was my end project for secondary school. This Discord bot has
  a full documentation on how to contribute commands to its open source module
  repository. Prefixes, command names, which commands to enable were all
  customisable per server. This would allow the bot to have incredibly specific
  functionality, without bloating up servers that didn't want those functions,
  or had those prefixes in use by other bots.
pro:
  - A webhook in the bot would pull new modules when pushed onto the main
    branch, and then bot would reboot itself.
  - Expansive documentation on how to develop commands (modules) for the bot.
  - This amount of customisation has only become a standard a few years later,
    when Discord added those options into their Integrations API.
con:
  - While well documented, the command/module creation relied on a lot of
    boilerplate/rigid code.
  - The bots existence became redundant due to the bot market quickly becoming
    over-saturated.
  - While the bots functionality was ahead of its time, its now pretty current
    of its time.
