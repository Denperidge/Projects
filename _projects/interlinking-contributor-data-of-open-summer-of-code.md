description: Interlinking all the publicly available data of recent OSOC
  editions, so its all linked and navigate-able!
pro:
  - Everything is parsed and stored in memory, using custom Typescript classes &
    interfaces
  - Automated deployment to GitHub Pages
  - Easily expandable for new editions, while being adaptable for data structure
    differences
  - Uses public & open data from the OSOC website repository
  - After some data parsing (which is automated in deployment), it works
    entirely client-side.
con:
  - The documentation on how to add additional years could be better.
